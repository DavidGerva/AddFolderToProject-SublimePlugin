Add Folder To Project
=====================

With this plugin you can open a file in sublime and easily add the file folder to the project.
I created it because I often edit files in sublime opening it directly from MS Visual Studio (I created the shortcut Alt+S in VS) or with F4 from TotalCommander and I generally find useful having the directory in the project or copying the file path in the clipboard.

Usage
-----
Just right click on the view or open the command panel and choose the operation.

**Add Folders To Project:**
Opens a list of the directories from the root to the file's directory.

![Add Folders To Project](./images/AddFolders.png)

**Add This Folder To Project:**
Add directly the file's directory to the project. 

![Add This Folders To Project](./images/AddThisFolder.png)

**Copy File Path**:
![Copy Path](./images/CopyPath.png)

Copies the file path to the clipboard.

**Copy Dir Path**:
Copies the file's dir path to the clipboard.

ToDo
----
1. Add the settings file to allow the user to choose which menu item to visualize both in the righ-click menu and in the operation panel (Ctrl+Shift+P).
