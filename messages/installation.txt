Add Folder To Project
=====================

With this plugin you can open a file in sublime and easily add the file folder to the project.
I created it because I often edit files in sublime opening it directly from MS Visual Studio (I created the shortcut Alt+S in VS) or with F4 from TotalCommander and I generally find useful having the directory in the project or copying the file path in the clipboard.

If you have recommendations or opinions just drop me a message or clone on github. ;)
Thank you!
