Add Folder To Project - 1.1.0
=============================

Here what's new with this update 1.1.0!

- Fixed menu item visibility with file without a phisical path
- If there is no phisical paths now the plugin asks for a custom path
- If a directory already exists in the project it won't be shown in the list dialog
- If the file's directory already exists in the project in the left click menu you'll now see not the "add this folder to project" but a new more useful "remove this folder from poject". Quite self-explaining, I think.
- Now you can create a blank new project starting from the opened file with the command (in the Ctrl+Shift+P Menu) "Create Project from File". This command will open a new sublime window with a new project containing only the file's directory. *I can't try it under OsX* so I just copied two lines of code from another project (thanks to the SideBarEnhancements sublime plugin). *OsX Users: can you please tell me if it works?!*. This will be really appreciated.

If you have recommendations or opinions you're always welcome! Just drop me a message or clone on github. ;)
Thank you!
